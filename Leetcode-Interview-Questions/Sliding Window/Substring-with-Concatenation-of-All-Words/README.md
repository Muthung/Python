## Substring with Concatenation of All words

### Question 

You are given a string *s* and an array of strings *words*. All the strings of *words* are of the same length.

A concatenated substring in *s* is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of *words* concatenated.

    For example, if words = ["ab","cd","ef"], then "abcdef", "abefcd", "cdabef", "cdefab", "efabcd", and "efcdab" are all concatenated strings. "acdbef" is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.

Return the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in *s*. You can return the answer in any order.

#### Implementation 

Use a sliding window approach along with a hashmap to keep track of the words' frequencies in the given string *s*.
