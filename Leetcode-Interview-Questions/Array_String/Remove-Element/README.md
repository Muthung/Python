## Remove element

### question

Given an integer array *nums* and an integer *val*, remove all occurences of *val* in *nums* in-place.
The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in *nums* which are not equal
to *val*.

Consider the number of elemnts in *nums* which are not equal to *val* be *k*, to get accepted, you need to 
do the following things:
                        - Change the array *nums* such that the first *k* elements of *nums* contain the 
                          elements which are not equal to *val*. The remaining elements of *nums* are not 
                          importantas well as the size of *nums*.
                        - Return *k*.

#### Custom Judge

The judge will test your solution with the following code.

> int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
> int val = ...;     // Value to remove
> int[] expectedNums = [...];  // The expected answer with correct length.
>                             // It is sorted with no values equaling val.
> int k - removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

> assert k == expectedNums.length;
> sort(nums, 0, k); // sort the first k elements of nums
> for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
> assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
> }

If assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.
